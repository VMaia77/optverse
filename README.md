## **OptVerse**

OptVerse is a Python library designed for general optimization with a primary focus on personal use and experimentation. While the current version focuses on implementing the continuous genetic algorithm, it serves as a foundation for broader optimization capabilities in future releases.

### Key Features

- Continuous Genetic Algorithm: OptVerse currently features a implementation of the continuous genetic algorithm, providing an effective solution for continuos optimization problems across various domains.

- Object-Oriented Interface: Built on an object-oriented interface, OptVerse offers a flexible and customizable framework. This allows users to adapt the library to specific optimization needs and experiment with different approaches seamlessly.

- Configurability: Tailor the optimization process to your requirements using customizable parameters, enabling fine-tuning for diverse problem domains.

### Why OptVerse?

OptVerse is an open-source project, welcoming contributions from the community. The objective is to collaboratively build a optimization library that can be utilized for a wide range of real-world applications in the future.

While the current version emphasizes the continuous genetic algorithm, the long-term vision for OptVerse is to evolve into a comprehensive library for general optimization challenges. By refining the codebase, incorporating user feedback, and expanding functionality, the aim is to make OptVerse a reliable tool for practical scenarios.

### Getting Started

To begin using OptVerse, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the OptVerse project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optverse.git
   ```

2. **Clone the OptVerse project:**
    ```bash
    cd optverse
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**
    
    Refer to the examples provided in the docs directory. Experiment, provide feedback, and contribute to the project's development.

In future release this process can be replaced with automatic installation.
