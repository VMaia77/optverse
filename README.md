## **OptVerse**

OptVerse is a python library designed for optimization with a primary focus on personal use and experimentation. While the current version focuses on implementing the continuous genetic algorithm, it must serves as a foundation for optimization capabilities in future releases.

### Key Features

- Continuous Genetic Algorithm: OptVerse currently features a implementation of the continuous genetic algorithm, providing an solution for continuos optimization problems.

- Object-Oriented Interface: Built on an object-oriented interface, OptVerse is flexible and customizable. This allows to adapt the library to specific optimization needs and experiment with different approaches.

### Why OptVerse?

OptVerse is an open-source project, welcoming contributions from the community. The objective is to collaboratively build a optimization library that can be utilized for a wide range of experimentations and applications in the future.

### Getting Started

To begin using OptVerse, follow these steps:

1. Clone the OptVerse project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optverse.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd optverse
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    
    Refer to the examples provided in the docs directory. Experiment, provide feedback, and contribute to the project's development.

In future release this process can be replaced with automatic installation.
